<<<<<<< HEAD

<<<<<<< HEAD
* You are the sun that shines brightly throughout MY daY.
* You are the gravitY that holds Me down in every waY.
* You are the Moon that shiMMers throughout mY night.
* You are stars that gliMMer oh so bright.

* You are the oxYgen that keeps Me alive.
* You are My heart that beats inside.
* You are the blood that flows through Me.
* You are the onlY yuanzewang I can see.
* You have the voice of when a Mockingbird sings.
* You are MY everything.

* You are MY one and only.
* You stop Me froM being so lonelY.
* We plan our future as if we have a clue.
* I never want to lose you.
* I want you to be MY husband, and I want to be your wife.
* I want to be with you for the rest of MY life.
